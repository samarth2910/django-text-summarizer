## 📝 Extractive Text Summarization (NLP + Django)
This project is an Extractive Text Summarizer that condenses long text into a concise summary by selecting the most important sentences — built using Python, Django, and pure CSS.

## 🌐 Live Demo

🔗 [Check it out here](https://django-text-summarizer-production.up.railway.app/)

## 🚀 Features
Automatically summarizes large text inputs

Clean and responsive UI using vanilla CSS

Built-in Django form to process and display summaries

Deployed and publicly accessible

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python 3

Django (for backend + frontend rendering)

NLTK (for NLP processing)

HTML + CSS (for UI styling)

Railway (for deployment)

## 📦 Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samarth2910/django-text-summarizer.git
cd summarizer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

## 🧠 How It Works
**Text Preprocessing:**

Tokenizes the input into words and sentences

**Filters out stopwords and punctuation

**Sentence Scoring:**

Scores each sentence based on word frequency

**Summary Generation:**

Picks top-scoring sentences to form the final summary

## ✨ Example
**Input:**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries with applications like image recognition, voice assistants, and more. It uses algorithms and massive data to replicate human-like thinking and decision-making...

**Summary Output:**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries with applications like image recognition, voice assistants, and more.

## ✅ Future Ideas
Upload .txt or .pdf for summarization

Add summary length control

Add abstractive summarization (e.g., using BERT or T5)
